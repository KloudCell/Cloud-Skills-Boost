# **To be done using Google Cloud Shell**

**1. Create a new dataset and table to store the data**

**2. Execute the query to see how many unique products were viewed**

**3. Execute the query to use the UNNEST() on array field**

**4. Create a dataset and a table to ingest JSON data**

**5. Execute the query to COUNT how many racers were there in total**

**6. Execute the query that will list the total race time for racers whose names begin with R**

**7. Execute the query to see which runner ran fastest lap time**
