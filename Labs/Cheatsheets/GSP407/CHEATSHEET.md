# **To be done using Google Cloud Shell**

**1. Identify duplicate rows**

**2. Write basic SQL on ecommerce data**

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_duplicate_rows, * FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`

HAVING num_duplicate_rows > 1;'

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS unique_visitors
