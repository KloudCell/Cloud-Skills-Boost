4. **An organization has a new application, and user subscriptions are growing faster than on-premises infrastructure can handle. What benefit of the cloud might help them in this situation?**

    - It's scalable, so the organization could shorten their infrastructure deployment time.✅

    - It provides physical access, so the organization can deploy servers faster.

    - It's cost effective, so the organization will no longer have to pay for computing once the app is in the cloud.

    - It's secure, so the organization won't have to worry about the new subscribers data.

5. **An organization has made significant investments in their own infrastructure and has regulatory requirements for their data to be hosted on-premises. Which cloud implementation would best suit their needs?**

    - Software as a service

    - Private Cloud✅

    - Public Cloud

    - Platform as a service

7. **What is seen as a limitation of on-premises infrastructure, when compared to cloud infrastructure?**

    - The on-premises networking is more complicated.

    - Maintenance workers do not have physical access to the servers.

    - Scaling processing is too difficult due to power consumption.

    - The on-premises hardware procurement process can take a long time.✅

&nbsp;

8. **What is the benefit of implementing a transformation cloud that is based on open infrastructure?**

    - On-premises software isn't open source, so cloud applications are more portable.

    - Open source software makes it easier to patent proprietary software.

    - Open source software reduces the chance of vendor lock-in.✅

    - Open standards make it easier to hire more developers.
